# Interaction-of-DIgSILENT-PowerFactory-and-Python-in-Power-System-Harmonic-Simulation-
The harmonic stability of the power transmission system is simulated with DIgSILENT PowerFactory and embedded in a Python script to automate the EMT simulation. Further data analysis process is illustrated in Jupyter notebook with csv data exported by PowerFactory.
